# Persist

Persist is a RxSwift helper for persisting stuff line (Codable) Encodable-Decodable, UIImage (.png or .jpg) along with Data into disk.

  - Supports Coddable (Encodable or Decodable)
  - UIImage as .jpg or .png
  - Data as binary
  - Can add Folder or File hierarchy easily

# New Features (v1.0.0)

  - RxSwift 4.5 for Swift 4.2 support
  - Lazy initialization on call (not allocated on memory until needed)

Easy to use interface on access only allocation with singleton pattern, you can even expend image caching into more robust way with this read and write operations.

### Tech

Persist uses open source project to work properly:

* [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) - Checkout RxSwift on github

### Installation

Persist requires [Swift4.2](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-2-released/)

Install Persist via CocoaPods.

```pod
pod 'Persist', :git => "https://github.com/droideveloper/Persist", :branch => "release/1.0.0"
```

### How to use

```swift
let persist = Persist.default()
// create file inside of documents folder (there are some more options in here, including more paths)
let file = File.create(.document, name: "people.cache")

// if we read array
let disposable: Disposable = persist.readAsync(file) { people: [Person] in 
    // we can grab our array in here
}
// if we read single object
let disposable: Disposable = persist.readAsync(file) { person: Person in
    // we can grab our person in here
}

// if we want to cancel operation of reading before compeleted, RxSwift will be help
disposable.dispose()

// example object
struct Person: Codable {
    var name: String?
    var surname: String?
}

```
